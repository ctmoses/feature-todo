# Purpose

> When Vue.js projects start to get large, they get messy. A feature based project organizes code around only allowing data to be used where needed rather than making it available everywhere. This is a simple todo app made to be an example to build much larger apps. I'll detail more about the hows/whys in the future.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
